	Consider a particle on a number line starting at zero with a certain probability of moving right or left at any given step. My goal was to determine the relationship between these probabilities and the number where the particle ends up after several steps. My code takes the probability of moving right and moving left as inputs, then randomly moves a simulated “particle” 10,000 times according to these probabilities, recording the particle’s ending point on the number line. Let us call this a single “random walk” with 10,000 steps. The program finds the median ending point of 10,000 different walks. After graphing various probabilities against their corresponding median end values, I noticed that the relationship between the probabilities of moving left/right and the ending point of the walk is linear. Furthermore, a 1% change in the probabilities changes the walk’s median end value by approximately 2% of the number of steps in the walk.
